# 2-player-tic-tac-toe
Contains simple C code for 2 player based tic tac toe game</br>
Doesn't contain graphics</br>
Compiled code is supposed to be run in the terminal itself</br>
I have uploaded the Linux Executable as well. If it doesn't work, compile the code yourself, it is error-free</br></br>
## Features of the code
Basically a two player tic tac toe game which gives players chance to input the position they wish to mark with an X or an O, alternately.</br>
When one of the users wins, program congratulates the winning user and they come out of the program</br></br>
The features include-
* If the user enters number out of the range of 1-9 for position, there will be a prompt to tell the user to input between 1 to 9 and gives a retry option.
* If the user tries to access already marked position, a prompt comes and user is told to retry</br>

### Note:
If you download the executable, you have to give it permission to be executable as program.</br>
In Linux with a GUI, right click on the executable and go to Properties->Permissions and check the **Allow executing as a file** box.
